            <p>
                I'm a 20 year old 3rd year student studying computer science at York University. I have advanced
                knowledge in several different programming languages as well as advanced knowledge in various data structures.
                Over my three years I have obtained a great understanding of mobile app environments such as Android Studio and
                Xcode. I have a passion for computer science, I love the trial and error and problem solving aspects of it
                which makes learning extremely enjoyable. I also get a large satisfaction, like I am sure most other computer
                scientist's in seeing progress and the final results of my projects. I seek to continue to further my knowledge 
                in the industry, always trying to learn more and more on my own on top of what I learn at from my studies at York University.

                I am highly proficient in both Java and C, knowing their workings on a high level and have a very good
                understanding of complex ideas within the two. I also have plenty of expierence with website design using HTML, CSS, 
                and Javascript. As mentioned before I also have experience in mobile app environments. I learned the workings of 
                Android Studio through studies at York University and have taken that knowledge to make some of 
                my own apps within the environment. I also have experience in Python which I continue to experiment
                with and practice on my free time. I have a tremendous understanding of various data structures as well.  
                I also have an intermediate understanding of Unix operating system. I continue to learn everyday and hunger 
                for knowledge. I know there is always more to understand and look to continue to expand what I know.
